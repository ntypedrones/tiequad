# TieQuad

TieQuad is a project aiming to produce a lightweight quadcopter frame, accepting that parts may break in a light crash, but making sure that these breakable parts are easy to manufacture and replace.

The quadcopter frame consists of four hub peices and four motor mount peices, these are intended to be CNC cut from 1mm aluminium. These peices interface with two lengths of 10mm box section making up the arms, crossing at the centre.

Cable ties hold the plates to the arms with friction, this means the arms require no complex manufacture at all, only cutting to length.
